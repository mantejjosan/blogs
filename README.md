# Blogs Repository

This repository contains Markdown files designed to be rendered using **Hugo** instead of GitHub's default Jekyll rendering.

## Purpose of the Repository

The primary purpose of this repository is to **test and refine a GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow** that automates the rendering of Markdown files into HTML using Hugo. 

**Great news!** ðŸŽ‰ The workflow has been successfully developed and is fully operational. It detects changes in Markdown files, triggers Hugo to render them into HTML, and deploys the content seamlessly. This repository served as a testing ground, ensuring everything works smoothly before implementing it elsewhere.

### Why Hugo?

We chose Hugo for the following reasons:
- **Speed**: Hugo generates static sites faster than Jekyll.
- **Flexibility**: Hugo's support for custom themes and configurations aligns better with our long-term goals.

This repository validated the workflow, and it is now ready for broader use.

## Workflow Highlights

The GitHub Actions workflow performs the following:
1. Detects changes in Markdown files.
2. Triggers Hugo to render the Markdown into HTML.
3. Deploys the rendered content to the appropriate hosting platform or branch.

For detailed information about GitHub Actions workflows, check out the documentation: [GitHub Actions Overview](https://solidpoint.ai/s/Z_7RIuf_Z-Q).

### Application to Notefy

With the workflow tested and operational here, it will now be implemented in **[Notefy](https://github.com/your-username/notefy)**. This completes our migration from Jekyll to Hugo, enabling a faster and more efficient rendering process.
