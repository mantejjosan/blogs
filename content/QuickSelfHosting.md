# Host Your Site Without Spending A Buck! ðŸ¤¯
 
Today, youâ€™ll learn how to set up your site on the internet without spending a penny! You can use your phone or laptop as a hosting service by setting up a local server using Flask and exposing it to the internet with Cloudflare and the Cloudflare daemon.

## What We Are Trying to Achieve

Ever designed a frontend that you desperately want to showcase to your friends, teammates, or clients for quick feedback? Or perhaps you want to test your websiteâ€™s vulnerabilities to enhance its security? No matter your goal, this guide will show you how to make your local project accessible online in minutes.

## Steps

These steps focus on Linux, but there are alternatives available for Windows as well. If you're using a phone, check out [this tutorial for mobile]({{< relref "SelfHostingWithMobile.md" >}}).

### 1. Create a Site

Start by creating the project or site you want to showcase. It could be a blog, portfolio, or even a simple Markdown file converted into HTML.

### 2. Set Up a Local Server

To share your website, youâ€™ll need a local server. Think of it like sharing an image via AirDrop or WhatsApp: the server hosts your files, and users can access them by requesting the files from the server.

**Ways to Set Up a Local Server:**
- **Using VSCode/Code Editor**: Use the built-in "Live Server" extension.
- **Manual Setup**: Use frameworks like Flask or Express.js.

For simplicity, weâ€™ll use Flask here (works for both laptops and phones).

#### Steps to Set Up Flask:

1. Open your terminal or PowerShell.
2. Install Flask using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```
3. Create the necessary directories:
```bash
mkdir server templates
```

4. Create a Flask app:
```bash
vim app.py
```
Paste the following code:
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return render_template("index.html")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()

```

5. Place your index.html inside the templates folder. To serve a custom page, modify the render_template line above.


6. Run your server:
```bash
flask run
```

For real-time updates during development, use:
```bash
flask run --debug
```

For now, stop the server after confirming it works. Weâ€™ll restart it after setting up the Cloudflare tunnel.

3. Create a Cloudflare Tunnel

To make your local server accessible over the internet, weâ€™ll use Cloudflare tunnels. This ensures a secure connection without needing to configure port forwarding or deal with NAT traversal.

Steps:

1. Create a Cloudflare Account: Sign up for a free account on Cloudflare.


2. Install Cloudflared:

- For Windows: Follow the official guide.

- For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:
```bash
wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
```

- For Arch-based systems:
```
yay -S cloudflared

```

3. Create a Tunnel: Run the following command, replacing <server-url> with the URL of your running Flask or live server:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url <server-url>

```

4. Restart your Flask server:
```bash
flask run

```

Bonus Tip: Automate the Process

Running two servers (Flask and Cloudflare) in separate terminals can be tedious. Use the following script to simplify the process:

1. Create a script called host.sh:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
flask run &
cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:5000

```

2. Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x host.sh
```

3. Run the script:
```bash
./host.sh

```

This will start both servers simultaneously.

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve successfully hosted your local site online. Now, share the Cloudflare-provided link with your friends, teammates, or clients for quick access.

Happy hosting! ðŸš€
